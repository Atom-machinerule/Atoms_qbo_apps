Atoms_qbo_apps
==============

A ROS stack of apps for my QBO robot under ROS "Electric". See the git branches for compatiable list of versions to newer ROS Releases. I have choose to list this as a directory that can be installed easily with  " rosmake --rosdep-install Atoms_qbo_apps " You may choose to delete packages that may already be installed or don't want on your QBO.
